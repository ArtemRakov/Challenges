# String Reversal

Initially, Write you solution in the lib/reverse_string.rb file and get the RSpec tests to pass. Once that is done, copy your solution to the solutions directory. Restore lib/reverse_string.rb to original state.

The task is to reverse a string so that the method reverse_string with a parameter of "too" will return "oot". Complete this exercise without using the .reverse method.

To run RSpec, change the directory you're in to the 01 - String-Reversal directory and run bundle and then rspec.
