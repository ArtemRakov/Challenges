 1. String Reversal - The task is to reverse a string so that the method reverse_string with a parameter of "too" will return "oot". Complete this exercise without using the .reverse method.

 2. String Equivalence - Two strings are considered equivalent if they both contain same alphabets. For example, "foobar" and "rabfoo" are considered equivalent, but "FOOBAR" is not (note the capital letters). Write String#equivalent_with? method to complete this exercise.
