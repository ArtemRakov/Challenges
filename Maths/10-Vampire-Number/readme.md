# Vampire Number

A vampire number is a natural number with an even number of digits, that can be factored into two integers. These two factors are called the fangs, and must have the following properties:

* they each contain half the number of the digits of the original number
* together they consist of exactly the same digits as the original number
* at most one of them has a trailing zero

An example of a Vampire number and its fangs: ```1260 : (21, 60)```
